This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from Hack the Boo 2023. This was also my very first CTF and writeup so the explanations might be super scuffed. With hindsight, the challenges were actually pretty simple but I guess everyone starts from the bottom.

## Scenario (Practice Challenges)
> Prepare yourselves, travelers! <br><br>
Creatures have been stirring in the depths of night. Monstrosities emboldened by the lack of monster slayers have heard their names spoken under fearful breaths. As the Hack The Boo tales are brought to life over a campfire, the unsuspecting villagers cling to the light of the fire in hopes of an even brighter dawn. <br><br>
The elders are here to guide you in your battles...
