If you're into cybersecurity and looking for a solid open-source SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool, Wazuh is worth checking out.

## **Wazuh Components**  

Wazuh is made up of several key components that work together to collect, analyze, and visualize security data:  

### **1. Wazuh Manager**  
This is the core of Wazuh. It processes data from agents, applies security rules, and generates alerts. The manager is responsible for log analysis, file integrity monitoring, intrusion detection, and compliance checks.  

### **2. Wazuh Agents**  
Agents are installed on the endpoints (servers, desktops, cloud instances, etc.) to collect security data and send it to the Wazuh Manager. They monitor logs, file changes, and system activity to detect threats.  

### **3. Wazuh Indexer (Based on OpenSearch)**  
The indexer stores and indexes security data for efficient searching and analysis. It replaces Elasticsearch in newer Wazuh versions and is optimized for performance and scalability.  

### **4. Wazuh Dashboard (Kibana UI)**  
The dashboard provides a graphical interface for analyzing logs, viewing alerts, and managing security events. It's built on Kibana and offers real-time insights into system security.  

### **5. Wazuh API**  
The API allows integration with other security tools and automation of tasks. It enables users to interact with Wazuh programmatically, retrieve alerts, manage agents, and perform searches.

## **Setting Up Wazuh**  

Setting up Wazuh might seem complex at first, but once you break it down, itâ€™s pretty straightforward.  

### **Step 1: Install Wazuh Manager**  
The Wazuh Manager is the core component responsible for processing data and generating alerts. Youâ€™ll need a Linux machine (Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS recommended).  

1. Update your system:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. Add the Wazuh repository and install the Wazuh Manager:  
   ```bash
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh  
   sudo bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-manager  
   ```
3. Start and enable the Wazuh Manager service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now wazuh-manager  
   ```

### **Step 2: Install Wazuh Agent (On a Client Machine)**  
The Wazuh Agent collects data from the machine it's installed on and sends it to the Wazuh Manager.  

1. Add the Wazuh repository:  
   ```bash
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh  
   sudo bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-agent  
   ```
2. Configure the agent to connect to the Wazuh Manager:  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf  
   ```
   Find the `<address>` tag and enter the IP of your Wazuh Manager.  
3. Restart the agent: 
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now wazuh-agent  
   ```

### **Step 3: Install Wazuh Dashboard (For Visualization)**  
For a user-friendly interface, Wazuh integrates with **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  

1. Install the Wazuh Dashboard:  
   ```bash
   sudo bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-dashboard  
   ```
2. Start the service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now wazuh-dashboard  
   ```
3. Access the dashboard by going to `http://<your-server-ip>:5601` in your browser.
