# Setting Up Wazuh Agent on Ubuntu VM  

In my previous post, I explored Wazuh without an agent, just to get a feel for how things work. Now, itâ€™s time to level up and deploy the Wazuh agent on an **Ubuntu VM** to start monitoring system activities properly. This guide will walk through the setup process step by step.  

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites  
Before we begin, make sure:  
âœ… You have a **Wazuh Manager** running (installed on another server or VM).  
âœ… Your **Ubuntu VM** has internet access.  
âœ… You have **sudo** privileges on the Ubuntu VM.

## Step 1: Install the Wazuh Agent  
First, update the system and install necessary packages:  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https -y
```
Now, download and install the Wazuh agent:  
```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/wazuh-agent.deb
sudo dpkg -i wazuh-agent.deb
```
This installs the agent, but we still need to configure it to communicate with the Wazuh Manager.  

---

## Step 2: Configure the Agent  
Edit the Wazuh agent config file:  
```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```
Look for the `<client>` section and update the `<address>` field to point to your **Wazuh Managerâ€™s IP**:  
```xml
<client>
  <server>
    <address>YOUR_WAZUH_MANAGER_IP</address>
    <port>1514</port>
  </server>
</client>
```
Save and exit (`CTRL+X`, then `Y` and `Enter`).  

---

## Step 3: Enable and Start the Agent  
Now, enable and start the Wazuh agent:  
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
```
Check if itâ€™s running:  
```bash
sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent
```
If you see **"active (running)"**, then you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰  

---

## Step 4: Verify Connection on Wazuh Manager  
Go to your **Wazuh Manager** and check if the agent is connected:  
```bash
sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -l
```
If the agent appears in the list, everything is working fine. If not, you might need to check firewall settings or ensure the manager is reachable from the Ubuntu VM.  

---

## Step 5: Test the Agent  
To generate some logs and test if Wazuh detects them, try running:  
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
Then, create a test alert:  
```bash
sudo su -c "echo 'Test alert from Wazuh agent' >> /var/log/syslog"
```
If everything is set up correctly, this should show up in your Wazuh dashboard under **Alerts**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion  
Thatâ€™s it! Your Ubuntu VM is now running the Wazuh agent and sending logs to the manager. In the next post, I'll explore how to fine-tune the agent and set up rules for detecting **suspicious activity** like XSS and SQLi. Stay tuned!
