## 1. Introduction

I finally have the opportunity to continue my homelab project. This project was inspired by my internship as a Network Security Intern, where I was exposed to many security tools‚Äîespecially firewalls. During that time, I realized something important: although I had heard a lot about firewalls, I didn‚Äôt actually know how they looked or worked in practice.

My initial assumption was that a firewall was simply software, like the built-in Microsoft Firewall. However, in enterprise environments, a firewall is usually a dedicated networking appliance that sits between different network segments, inspecting and controlling traffic.

Since hardware firewalls are expensive (and frankly an overkill for a learning environment), I decided to explore the best open-source alternative available: pfSense.

### What is pfSense?

pfSense is an open-source firewall and router distribution based on FreeBSD. It provides a wide range of enterprise-grade features such as:

- Stateful packet filtering firewall
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- VPN (IPsec, OpenVPN, WireGuard)
- DHCP and DNS services
- Web-based GUI for easy management
- Advanced logging and monitoring

Thanks to its flexibility, pfSense can run not only on dedicated hardware but also on virtual machines, which makes it ideal for learning and homelabs.

### Homelab Setup

In this project, I set up pfSense inside VMware Workstation to simulate a small enterprise network. The goal is to understand how pfSense works as a firewall and security gateway, and to test different scenarios, including:

1. Firewall as DHCP Server 
2. DMZ setup.
3. Firewall Rules ‚Äì controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
4. Web Server in DMZ ‚Äì exposing services while keeping LAN secure.

## 2. Network Architecture

The virtual lab is designed to resemble a typical enterprise network with three main zones:

- WAN (Untrusted Zone): Simulates the internet.
- LAN (Trusted Zone): Represents internal users and workstations.
- DMZ (Semi-Trusted Zone): Hosts public-facing servers such as a web server or mail server.

## 3. Firewall as DHCP Server
When I first played around with pfSense, one of the things I wanted to try was DHCP.  From my previous experience, DHCP usually been done by routers, so it is new knowledge that firewall can also do the same. 

DHCP basically automatically assigns IPs on every machine in the network. This is super useful if you don‚Äôt want to bother about asigning new machine IP address by yourseelf. Although in certain case where, static IP is more prefer for critical server that require consistent IP.

So here‚Äôs the idea, I configure pfSense to act as the DHCP server for both of these subnet. That way, whenever a new VM boots up, it just asks pfSense for an IP and pfSense will auto assign it based on the remaining address ppol:

- My LAN (192.168.1.0/24): Kali and host Window.
- My DMZ (192.168.2.0/24): Lubuntu with web server.

### How I Set It Up

1. Log into the pfSense web dashboard.
2. Go to Services > DHCP Server.
3. On the LAN tab, tick ‚ÄúEnable DHCP.‚Äù
4. I set the range to something like `192.168.1.100 ‚Äì 192.168.1.200` (so I know all dynamic clients will sit in that range).
5. I did the same for the DMZ tab, but with the `192.168.2.100 ‚Äì 192.168.2.200` range.

That‚Äôs it. Now pfSense is ready to hand out addresses automatically.

### Testing It

Once DHCP is enabled, I just start up one of my Linux VMs and run:
```
ip a
```

Kali VM picks up an IP from pfSense automatically. I also check with dhcpclient to see how the DHCP process work behind the scene.

To double-check, I also looked at the DHCP Leases page in pfSense, and I could see my Kali machine listed there with the IP it got assigned.

üü¢ Step 1: LAN Rules

Goal: Allow LAN clients ‚Üí Internet, but not directly to DMZ.

1, Go to Firewall > Rules > LAN.

2. Delete the default ‚ÄúLAN to any‚Äù rule.

3. Add rules:

- Allow LAN ‚Üí WAN

  - Action: Pass
  
  - Interface: LAN
  
  - Source: LAN net
  
  - Destination: any
  
  - Save + Apply

- Block LAN ‚Üí DMZ

  - Action: Block
  
  - Interface: LAN
  
  - Source: LAN net
  
  - Destination: DMZ net
  
  - Save + Apply

‚úÖ LAN can browse internet, but cannot reach DMZ.

üü† Step 2: DMZ Rules

Goal: Allow DMZ servers ‚Üí Internet for updates, block DMZ ‚Üí LAN.

Go to Firewall > Rules > DMZ.

Add rules:

Block DMZ ‚Üí LAN

Action: Block

Interface: DMZ

Source: DMZ net

Destination: LAN net

Allow DMZ ‚Üí WAN

Action: Pass

Interface: DMZ

Source: DMZ net

Destination: any

Save + Apply.

‚úÖ DMZ servers can go out to WAN, but cannot reach LAN.

From DMZ 192.L168.2.10, cannot ping to LAN network in this case I try toi ping the Windo host ip at 192.168.1.101.
